# Lyrics Generator

## Overview

The Lyrics Generator is a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload audio files and generate lyrics from those files. This project uses `pydub` for audio processing and integrates with a lyrics generation model. The application is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a clean interface for uploading files and viewing generated lyrics.

## Features

- **File Upload:** Users can upload audio files (MP3 or WAV format) to the server.
- **Audio Processing:** The application processes the uploaded audio files to extract relevant information.
- **Lyrics Generation:** Generates lyrics from the processed audio using a predefined model.
- **Error Handling:** Provides feedback if something goes wrong during the upload or processing stages.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.12 or higher**
- **Flask:** Web framework for building the application.
- **pydub:** Library for audio processing.
- **FFmpeg:** Required by `pydub` for audio file processing.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lyrics-generator.git
   cd lyrics-generator
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install FFmpeg:**

   - **Download and Install FFmpeg:** Visit [FFmpeg download page](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and follow the instructions to install FFmpeg.
   - **Add FFmpeg to PATH:** Ensure `ffmpeg` is added to your system’s PATH environment variable.

5. **Run the Application:**
